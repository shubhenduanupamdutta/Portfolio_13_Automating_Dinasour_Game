# Portfolio_13_Automating_Dinasour_Game

## Thirteenth (13) Portfolio Project: Automating Google Dinosaur Game
 - #### I will be automating game at [dinasour game](https://elgoog.im/dinosaur-game/) using Python and Pyautogui library. Since game directly on chrome can only be accessed when network is down.

## Some Notes:
 - You may have to adjust some parameters according to your screen size and computer speed
 - My computer is old and slow, so you need to optimize some of the parameters yourself.

## Version - 1 Bugs:
 - You should start at first screen, or run the program, and go to chrome and refresh the page
 - Right now for first iteration it fails but it restarts the game automatically and then works until night.
 - Program is incapable of handling color changes from day to night, so it fails at night.
